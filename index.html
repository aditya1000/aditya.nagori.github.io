        <h2>About</h2>
        <ul>
            As a data scientist with a doctorate in biomedical data science and extensive postdoctoral experience at premier institutions like UT Southwestern Medical Center and IIIT Delhi, I bring an expertise in predictive modeling and computational healthcare. My Ph.D. work, supported by a CSIR-GATE fellowship, focused on the prediction of critical events in critical care and was enriched by a research internship at Nvidia, where I honed deep learning skills for intensive care complications prediction.

My professional journey is marked by collaborations with multidisciplinary teams which resulted in numerous peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences. I have also built applications such as AnthroCal, which has achieved over 100,000 downloads globally.

In my postdoctoral roles, I have spearheaded projects using Bayesian Networks for heart-failure risk prognostication and have assessed digital health literacy, contributing to the understanding of social determinants of health. My work, at the intersection of data science and healthcare, aims to enhance patient outcomes through innovative research and practical applications.
